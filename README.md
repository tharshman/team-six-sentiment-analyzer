FIN6778 Team 6 Sentiment Analyzer

## Process

![Sentiment Workflow](https://github.com/vbortone/team-six-sentiment-analyzer/assets/373701/d78fb210-506c-49c8-93df-82553dcf3984)

## Project Split

I believe the programming work for these tools can be split into two halves:

1. Sentiment Analyzer  
    - Reaching each PDF
    - Scoring the sentiment for each document
    - Combining the scores for each security to get an aggregate score
    - Using the scores, export the top 5 choices with 200K allocated to each as a portfolio
2. Portfolio Analysis
    - Take the portfolio from Part 1 and compare it to the portfolio of Part 2
    - Track the performance of each portfolio from Aug 21, 2023 to Nov 18, 2023
    - Generate charts/tables comparing month by month for 22-Aug to 21-Sept, 22-Sept to 21-Oct, and 21-Oct to 18-Nov
